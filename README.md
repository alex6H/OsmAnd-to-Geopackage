# OsmAnd-to-Geopackage
The purpose of this script is to aggregate a set of GPX files (traces only, not POI) from the OsmAnd app. It allows to clean up the periods without displacement, to filter the too high or too low speeds, to determine a minimum displacement distance between two points and to remove the too abrupt angles.
